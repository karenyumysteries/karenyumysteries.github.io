# About me...

A mystic once told me that it I was destined to bring wisdom to the world. Then again, she was a scam artist who stole thousands of pounds worth of jewellery using a very ingenious trick involving helium balloons.
        
What is true is that I’ve always found the unexplained to grate like a personal insult. Even so, it was never my intention to investigate mysterious crimes and occurrences. After graduating from the University of Bristol in 1985 I worked in various reporting jobs before squeezing onto the writing staff at Witness, a small investigative magazine that punches well about its journalistic weight.
        
It was there, in the summer of 1991, that things took a turn for the curious. I was interviewing the famed sceptic and debunker Andrew Paris, who had decided to lock himself up for the night in a haunted room of his house in a bid to disprove the legends about it. The windows were latched, the door was locked, and, lo and behold, he was duly shot under impossible circumstances. A combination of straightforward scepticism and ‘superhuman stubbornness’ (thanks Charlie) eventually led to the solution to [the problem of the panelled room](https://www.google.com), although it was by no means an easy process!
        
The attention generated by this case made me something of a target for the confused and bemused, and since 1991 I have found myself investigating, with varying degrees of reluctance, ghostly apparitions, UFO sightings, impossible thefts, vanishing cars and, of course, the Helium Mystic – who’s now serving a well-earned two-year stint at Drake Hall.
        
After numerous requests, this web site aims to collect and collate all my mystery solving escapades into one easy-to-surf place. I hope you enjoy exploring!
